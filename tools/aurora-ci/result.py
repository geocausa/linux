"""Turn the kernel CI jobs' results into the one required check.

Branch protection and the merge queue require a single check, so this job
decides what the run as a whole means. A job that was supposed to run must
have succeeded; a skipped job passes only when the plan skips it on purpose:

  - full-run jobs (package, kunit, boot) are skipped on a light run;
  - kunit and boot are skipped when an earlier run already verified the same
    build key (same kernel tree and packaging inputs);
  - commit, compile and device tree checks are skipped for events without a
    pull request or merge group range (push, schedule, manual runs).

A light run that passes says only that the checks passed: the kernel itself
is built in the merge queue, and the summary says so.
